**ðŸ“Š Real-Time Process Monitoring Dashboard**

**1. Project Overview**
Goals:
The primary goal of the Real-Time Process Monitoring Dashboard is to build a system that provides live visualization of crucial system metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, and process activity. This tool allows system administrators to quickly identify performance bottlenecks, unresponsive processes, or excessive resource consumption, enabling real-time system health diagnostics and responsive management.

Expected Outcomes:

A responsive, browser-based dashboard displaying live data.

Visualization of top CPU/memory-consuming processes.

Alerts or visual indicators for abnormal usage.

Intuitive interface for system administrators to monitor and potentially act on resource-heavy processes.

Scope:
This dashboard focuses on real-time monitoring rather than predictive modeling. Itâ€™s designed for viewing live stats and optionally providing actions like process termination. The project combines OS-level data gathering (via Python) with a frontend for real-time updates (HTML + JS), making it both practical and educational in terms of systems programming and web development.

**2. Module-Wise Breakdown**
The project is modularized into three major components:

ðŸ”¹ Module 1: Analytics Module (Python Backend)
Purpose: Gathers and processes system information.

Role: Uses the psutil library to fetch data like CPU percentage, memory stats, and active processes. Provides this info in JSON format through a local server or API.

ðŸ”¹ Module 2: Web Interface (HTML + JS Frontend)
Purpose: Displays the real-time data visually to users.

Role: Fetches live data from the backend using periodic AJAX calls (via fetch()), then updates the DOM with CPU/memory graphs and process tables.

ðŸ”¹ Module 3: Communication Layer
Purpose: Bridges the backend and frontend.

Role: Ensures efficient data transfer using a local Flask server (or similar) that serves the HTML and streams data through endpoints.

**3. Functionalities**
âœ… Real-Time Data Fetching
Gathers current CPU usage (%), RAM usage, and per-process statistics.

Uses psutil to ensure cross-platform compatibility.

âœ… Live Graphs and Tables
Updates the dashboard every few seconds using JavaScript intervals.

Displays:

CPU usage with a live chart.

Memory usage.

Top processes (sorted by CPU or memory).

âœ… Simple & Responsive UI
Uses clean HTML, basic styling, and DOM manipulation to reflect real-time changes.

Color-coded alerts (e.g., red if CPU > 90%).

âœ… Optional Stretch Features
Kill a process directly from the dashboard.

Add filters or sorting options.

**4. Technology Stack**
Python 3: Backend logic and system data analytics using psutil.

Flask (or HTTPServer): Serves data as JSON to frontend.

HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Frontend interface.

AJAX / Fetch API: Handles periodic data polling.

**5. Execution Plan**
Set Up Python Backend:

Use psutil to extract CPU, memory, and process info.

Create endpoints (e.g., /metrics, /top-processes) to expose this data.

Build Frontend Interface:

Design index.html to include:

CPU usage section

Memory usage section

Process list

Use fetch() with setInterval() to poll backend every few seconds.

Integration:

Connect frontend to backend.

Test JSON responses and DOM updates.

Polish UI:

Add styling.

Use conditional color coding (green/yellow/red) based on system load.

Testing & Debugging:

Run stress tests (e.g., open many processes).

Verify responsiveness and update speed.

**6. Sample JSON Output from Backend**
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "cpu_usage": 72.5,
  "memory_usage": 65.1,
  "top_processes": [
    {"pid": 1234, "name": "chrome.exe", "cpu": 35.2, "memory": 210},
    {"pid": 5678, "name": "python.exe", "cpu": 18.9, "memory": 155}
  ]
}
**7. Efficiency Tips**
Minimize Polling Rate: Use a 2-3 second interval to balance responsiveness and system overhead.

Optimize JSON Size: Only send top N processes.

Keep UI Light: Avoid excessive DOM manipulationâ€”just update changed elements.

**8. Conclusion**
This dashboard serves as a lightweight yet effective system monitoring solution. It's perfect for visualizing real-time process states and resource usage, offering insights into system performance at a glance. It also strengthens your understanding of both OS internals and full-stack integration.
